## My process

### Built with

- HTML & CSS-only
- SCSS/SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Although this is a simple design, it shows the foundations of styling with SASS.

Some variables are separated into files, in order to keep all stuff organized.

For instance:

__typography.scss_ 
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@500;700&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:wght@700&family=Montserrat:wght@500;700&display=swap');
```

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Download only what matters for your project.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - I beliave SASS really gives superpowers to CSS.
